      "\n",
      "### Career Highlights\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice's journey into technology began atypically, as she did not initially envision herself in the field. She majored in Computer Science in college and started her career at **Microsoft** in 2001, where she contributed to the development of the first **Xbox** and **Xbox Live**, including designing systems like the high-score system for Xbox Live. Her work at Microsoft also extended to enterprise software, such as Microsoft Project, showcasing her curiosity and willingness to explore diverse areas of technology [Data: Entities (88, 430, 434, 435, 431); Relationships (651, 653, 652)].\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to her corporate career, Alice co-founded a startup called **dynamicfeedback.com**, which focused on creating 360-degree surveys to improve workplace performance. This experience taught her the multifaceted nature of running a business, from coding to customer support and legal matters [Data: Entities (430); Sources (111)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advocacy and Leadership in Education\n",
      "\n",

Her advocacy extends to promoting interactive and hands-on methods for teaching computer science concepts, including non-computer-based activities to engage learners of all backgrounds [Data: Entities (88); Relationships (671, 655); Sources (113)].\n",
      "\n",
      "Through her work at Code.org, Alice has become a leading voice in the movement to make programming accessible to all students. She has highlighted the disproportionate impact of the lack of computer science education on underrepresented minorities and women, advocating for systemic changes to ensure every child has the opportunity to learn computer science [Data: Entities (88); Relationships (142, 154); Sources (113)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Public Engagement and Thought Leadership\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice frequently speaks on topics such as computer science education, diversity in technology, and strategies to improve gender balance in the tech workforce. She has shared her experiences and insights through platforms like the **Behind the Tech** podcast, where she discussed her career trajectory, her work at Code.org, and her efforts to address gender disparities in computer science [Data: Entities (88); Relationships (645, 140)].\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice Steinglass is a trailblazer in both technology and education, combining her technical expertise with a passion for advocacy.

      "116   child has the opportunity to learn computer science and that the students who are learning it look like the world. That the diversity matches, so that when we look at the workforce 20 years from now, whether somebody is in education or marketing or retail, they're going to be using computers. It's going to be a part of their lives and everybody gets to understand things like how the Internet works and how computers work. \\nAnd that when we look at the tech workforce, that the students who are prepared to join this, that they look the population, and I get to look around and half my team is female. I want to state that we're working on one part of the problem, which is the K12 education. That won't solve the tech workforce by itself. There are definitely issues around hiring, retention, workforce bias, all of those other pieces which also need to be solved. But, I think if they we're working on one really important part of the problem. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: We do need to bring more diversity into the tech workforce and I think education is critical. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think it really is. The thing that keeps me up at night about our future is I just look at every year technology has a bigger and bigger impact on the world and the trajectory tells us that that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. And in a whole bunch of different ways you want as many people and as representative a set of people as possible participating in the creation of this technology. You want all perspectives, all backgrounds, all ethnicities, you want it to look like the world, which I think was beautiful way that you said it. \\nBut, you also want society at large to be well informed because a lot of the funky stuff that's going on today we're going to have to make an increasingly large number of decisions, policy for instance, in ethics and the laws that we pass and the regulations that are put into place to govern the intersection of society and technology. You want people super well informed when we're making those decisions, and you want them represented--it's like everybody. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Absolutely. I mean, it's just critical that in this world, everybody has this opportunity. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: At Code.org, what we do is we make it as easy as possible for schools to teach this. We offer free curriculum, we offer free professional development for these teachers, we help teachers who don't have a computer science background. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Because the teachers don't. I mean our schools don't teach it. They didn't learn it when they went to school. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, giving the teachers the opportunity to learn to teach computer science. They're History teachers, English teachers, Math teachers. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Learning to teach computer science, as you pointed out earlier, is different than even knowing computer science. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Right. It is different. That's funny. We actually find that it's not the computer scientists make the best teachers of computer science. It's teachers teach computer science the best because they're good teachers. What we've found is that experienced teachers with no background in computer science make excellent computer science teachers because they know how to teach. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: If we give them the tools and the resources and the curriculum, they're fantastic in the classroom, and their students do really well. So, that's what we're working on doing. I mean, these schools teach computer science. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: What are some ahas that you've seen over the past several years trying to teach computer science kids? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Oh, there are so many. I'll give you a personal one to start out with. So, I came into this thinking I was a good computer science teacher, and it turned out surprise, surprise, I was not. I love teaching. I think a lot of people like me, they enjoy it. It's fun. I taught in college, I started a program to bring students into local schools to teach computer science. \\nI was TA, I was a teacher, and I always got good reviews. I always got high scores on the which TAs are the best, which teachers are the best. So, I had this misimpression that I was good at teaching. It's been fascinating getting to work with a bunch of pedagogy experts on how do you actually teach because what it turned out was that I was entertaining in front of a room, which is different from being a good teacher. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, when we teach networking, we have a thing called ABC CBV, which is you do the activity before the concept. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: You do the concept before the vocabulary. It's not about a teacher standing in front of a room lecturing. It's about letting kids discover it on their own. The art of teaching is stepping back. It's doing less. It's not being entertaining. It's not being this person who's like super energetic, exciting person to watch. It's about crafting experiences where the student is going to get to figure it out without you being involved. Because if they figure it out themselves, they're going to remember it. \\nSo, let's say, we're teaching TCPIP. We pair them up and we say, \"Hey, you guys got to figure out how to send some   \n",
      "113                                        it's their school doesn't teach it at all. So, even if they want to take it, they can't. This disproportionately affects students in high need schools. It disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and women who are discouraged from taking these classes. And the result is that because they never get this introduction in K12, it's really hard to start after that. It's really hard to start in college. So they may never go into the field. And even if they go into another field, they don't have that background in computer science. So, our goal is that every school should offer this course, so that every child has an opportunity to take it. At this point, we're the most popular computer science platform curriculum in K12 in the country. About 25 percent of students actually have an account on Code.org. So, we're reaching a lot of students but there's a long way to go. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So, how early should we be teaching kids computer science? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, this is totally different from how I started, but our recommendation is actually to start in elementary school, and there's some good reasons for doing this. Let me start by talking about how we teach about biology today, because I think it's a really good analogy for how I think about computer science education. \\nSo, every child when they go to elementary school gets to learn that they have bones, they have a digestive system, just the basics of how does my body work. We don't do that because they're all going to be doctors or nurses or EMTs. We do that because they're going to live with that body for the rest of their lives and they should know how it works. When they go to middle school maybe they learn more about it. In high school, a kid can take Biology or AP Biology. Even after they take all of those courses, all the way through K12, they're still not qualified. I don't trust a high school student who's taken AP Bio to do anything to me. So, there's still more work if they want to be a professional in the field, whether it's a nurse or a technician or anything. \\nComputer science is the same way. Every kid is going to be surrounded by technology their whole lives. We have our phones in our pockets, who knows where they're going to be when they grow up. The same way we get to know that we have a digestive system, they should understand, what is the Internet? What is the Cloud? What is data? How does this phone work? It's not a magic box that does magic magic. It's a computer, and what is a computer, right? These are just basics that should be part of our education system. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, I think of it in a very analogous way. In K5, we get to teach the students, what are these things? What is technology? Then, when they get to middle school, maybe they take more. If they're interested, they can take an AP Computer Science class in high school, and at the end of that, they're still not a programmer. They're going to go on and take a two-year degree. They could take a four-year degree. They can become a lifelong computer scientist. But, no matter what they do in life, it's useful to know how computers work. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, the same way we teach our kids how the body works, that's how we think about teaching it in elementary school. There's another reason to start so young, and that has to do with supporting diversity in computer science. What we see is that women tend to become less interested in the STEM fields around the middle school, early high school. In computer science, it's between about 12 and 14 when they lose interest. So, what we want to do is reach them before that year, so that while they're still interested in learning these things, we can show them what it is, so that if they're interested, they can keep going. \\nSo, there's a bunch of pieces here, part of it is encouraging them, thinking that they'll be good at it, getting that encouragement. If they're very confident in their ability to do it, they're four times more likely to go into computer science or take computer science classes than if they aren't. Girls, right now, oftentimes, they don't get this opportunity in elementary school, and so what happens is, when they're thinking about taking it in high school or middle school, they do it just based on the zeitgeist of what people tell them that they're going to be good at. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Right? Unfortunately, what we see is that they're often told they won't be good at computer science. Teachers are two and a half times more likely to tell a boy that he'll be good at computer science than a girl. And it's not because they're against it. These teachers are supportive, they care, it's just these cultural norms are embedded in our society. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, and kids are also pretty good pattern matchers. One of the things that I've noticed disturbingly with my own kids, I've got a eight-year old and a 10-year old right now, and very, very early when they were three, four years old, they would look around at the world and start making these classification decisions. It's okay, this is a boy thing and this is a girl thing, and this is without anything in their household telling them that thing A and thing B has a gender association with it. \\n   \n",
      "117                                                                                                                                                                                       back. It's doing less. It's not being entertaining. It's not being this person who's like super energetic, exciting person to watch. It's about crafting experiences where the student is going to get to figure it out without you being involved. Because if they figure it out themselves, they're going to remember it. \\nSo, let's say, we're teaching TCPIP. We pair them up and we say, \"Hey, you guys got to figure out how to send some messages back and forth.\" We have this little software that lets them send these little packets of messages back and forth. But, our software is going to drop some of those packets on the ground. We're just going to lose them. We're also going to send some of them out of order because that's how the Internet works, and they've got to figure out, \"Okay, I'm sending you messages, some of them come on out of order and some of them get dropped. How am I going to deal with this?\" \\nI don't care how they deal with it. Some of them will send five copies of the packet because there is going to be like, \"Okay let's just keep sending them because they're going to keep dropping them.\" Some of them will number them, some of them will send back [inaudible] to say, \"Yeah, I received or didn't receive your packet.\" It doesn't matter what method they come up with. The important part was that they really understood the problem because they tried to solve it. Then, after they've done that we say, \"Okay, that thing that you just did, that's called a protocol.\" \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: The protocol the Internet uses is called TCPIP. Now, what did the teacher do in that whole lesson? They facilitated the communication with the students. They got the students paired up, they helped a student who was blocked get to that next step. But nowhere in that lesson that the teacher stand up in front of the room and draw a picture of TCPIP. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I've had similar sorts of problems with my kids and it was the same thing for me at my goal in life was to be a computer science professor from age to when I left academia. I taught undergrads for years, I taught grad students, and now I'm trying to teach a couple of really young children about these computer science concepts. \\nAnd so I'm sitting down at a restaurant and teaching them about binary search, and that will give a total win. I think they got it right away because I made it into a guessing game. I'm going to teach you a trick for how you can get someone to play this guessing game with you where you can find the number that they guess between zero and  in seven steps or less. You know they're like, \"This is great.\" \\nBut, then I wanted to teach them how to do search, and there are like these little things about teaching search that sort of hard. One of the things is, if you just take a bunch of numbers and write them down and say, \"How would you sort these?\" One of the things that's interesting is human beings can see all of the numbers at one time. So, they're cheating in a sense when they're imagining how they're sorting. \\nAnd so I devised this thing where I could give them a bunch of blocks where the numbers on the blocks were covered up and, so they could go examine the number on the block one at a time, which is how the computer goes and does things. I just really realize that I was all kinds of wrong about how good I was going to be at teaching little children these computing concepts. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Actually, the way you ended up doing it is very similar to how we do it in our class. So, what we do is we give the kids decks of cards. They're only allowed to lift two at a time to compare them because that's how a computer would do it. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: They can't look at the cards when they flip on. They show him to the other student and the student says which one's bigger. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, they get to pick two at a time and see, and then actually, one of the things that's cool about that and a lot of our lessons is they're not on a computer. They're actually using physical cards in the classroom. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, which I think it's actually great. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: It's great. Yeah. Because you know when you say computer science, I think, sometimes people think, \"Oh, it's all on a computer,\" and really about half of our lessons are off the computer, and it's about interacting with other students. It's about internalizing the concepts by working with the actual concepts and the logic outside of the context of the computer. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Thank you so much for doing this work. I couldn't be a bigger fan and I think you guys are having an enormous and amazing impact on the world. Thank you for taking time to be on the show today. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Oh, no, thank you, and thank you for Microsoft's support. \\n\\n[MUSIC]\\n\\nKEVIN SCOTT: Well, thanks for joining us on Behind the Tech. I'm back with my colleague, Christina Warren. Some of Alice's insights were pretty awesome. What stood out for you? \\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So, one of the interesting things I thought about your conversation with Alice, and we talked about this a little bit before, was   \n",
      "112                                                                                                                                                                                                                     across the board, which is really interesting. \\nI went from that to looking at the Toolchain that developers use and working on XNA before it was XNA. Then I went from there, I said, \"What's the opposite of everything I've ever done?\" Right. I've been working on more the APIs, I haven't touched enterprise software and enterprise services and I just want to know what the other side looks like. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, I went to Office, I went over to Microsoft Project partially because it was just a very different space. I figured this was a good time to learn about a different space. I had a lot of people who thought it was the most insane thing they'd ever heard. Right. Why would anybody leave Xbox on purpose to go work on Project? \\nBut I actually found it really fascinating and interesting. Understanding about how do companies make purchases, and what does it mean to sell and to enterprise sales, and how do we make workplaces more efficient, and what is business software look like. I thought it was a really fascinating space. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: It sounds like one of the things that has driven a lot of your journey is just curiosity. You've explored a bunch different things, startups. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Yeah. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Ton of different things at Microsoft. Were you the kid that was taking all your mom's stuff apart, or asking five million questions? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: I mean, yes, but I think we all are. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, you think so? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Yeah, I think kids are naturally curious. I think we all want to learn. I think we all want to do that. I think there are barriers that hold us back, and some of those barriers can feel more real than they are, especially in tech. It's a booming space. There's a million jobs right now. Everybody's looking to hire. When I'm mentoring people I feel like talking to young people in tech. Sometimes they're afraid to make the choice, to try something new or to change. But, it's a false barrier they've put on themselves. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: One of the things that really strikes me about the industry over the past, let's just say, 10 or 15 years is, I think, in some ways we've gotten more complex. The number of programming languages, the number of frameworks, the whole ecosystem is just bigger. But, in a very real sense it's easier than it ever has been to go make something with code or with technology. \\nWhen I was in college, folks had this notion like, \"Oh, my God. Coding is so hard, you have to go get this degree, you have to practice.\" To get really great at anything, all that's true, but my kids can go make interesting things right now without a Computer Science degree because the tools that they have are so powerful. Is that something that you're seeing helping students get into computing? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Absolutely. There's a level of relevance, right? \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: When I was a kid, I made a game from my calculator that was [inaudible]. I made a game and I also made it formula solver cheat sheet kind of thing. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: But helped you with your physics formulas. This wasn't going to be the thing that took over America. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Right. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: But it was popular, among all the students in my class. Right? I think there's the same thing today. We see kids making games. There are some of those things are just not that complicated, right? \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, students have the potential to make things that are definitely cool. They're not as complex as an Xbox game, but they're cool. But, you also see that there's a lot of space for things that are locally relevant. Some of these kids' apps, there's one with their teacher's face, you could feed the teacher ice cream, but the teacher got a kick out of it, and it's fun, and it's cute, and it's relevant in that classroom. It's relevant in that school, your friends are all going to try it out. I think it gives you a taste of something without having to be an amazing artist, just like anything else, there will be steps. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Also, talk a little bit about what you do right now. So, you're the President of Code.org. So, tell us a little bit about what Code.org does. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, we build curriculum, we do professional development for teachers, we do advocacy work, but our goal is that every child should have the opportunity to take a computer science class in K12. I was shocked, especially from the tech industry. I was shocked to hear that most schools today don't teach computer science, and it's not even that most kids don't take it, it's their school doesn't teach it at all. So, even if they want to take it, they can't. This disproportionately affects students in high need schools. It disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and women who are discouraged from taking these classes. And the result is that because they never get this introduction in K12, it's really hard to start after that. It's really hard to start in college. So they may never go into the field. And even if they go into another field   \n",
      "115                                                                                                                                                                                                   , whereas starting earlier you can maybe get to the point where just naturally you're not having a class full of boys in 12th grade in this AP Computer Science. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Absolutely. We just hired a woman for our engineering team a couple of months ago who's studying computer science in college, was one of the only woman in her class, dropped out because she felt she didn't belong, but liked computer science. She liked it. She just didn't feel she should be in it because there weren't any other women in it, and finished college still regretted it. Still wanted to do computer science. Ended up doing night classes and side classes and learning it after work, eventually did a boot camp, learned computer science, moved into the career, worked as a computer scientist, and just recently joined our engineering team. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's awesome. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: But, you know that's the hard way. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. That's the hard way. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: It would have been easier if she had just been able to stay in those classes in the first place. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Yeah. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Tell us a little bit about Hour of Code. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, Hour of Code has just become a phenomenon. It's exceeded our expectations. If you're not in school right now, you may not have heard of it. If you're in school, you probably have. It's like Earth Day, but for computer science. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: It's a national holiday. I don't have the exact numbers or the number of which schools participate. But, as far as I can tell, everybody I talked to, their school seems to be doing it. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: I realized there was a bigger thing than I thought when Steph Curry was posting on LinkedIn about him doing his Hour of Code. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, if you're into sports, then Steph Curry did it. If you're into other things, Barack Obama's done it, Justin Trudeau's done it, Dave Cameron, that we've had about eight world leaders who've participated. We've had musicians. We've had actors, actresses. But, I think the most important thing is the schools and the teachers are doing it. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, tell folks what the Hour of Code actually is. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: So, the idea is that I can tell you, until I'm blue in the face, that computer science is going to be fun, that you can do it. There's nothing like actually trying it. So, what we do is we get students and teachers to spend one hour trying computer science. We've built scaffolded activities that make it easy for beginners. \\nIn one hour, they can actually build something. You could actually build a little, mini game, something you can share and be able to say, \"Hey, I did that,\" and you actually learned some computer science. I mean, you don't learn all of computer science, it's one hour, but you learn a concept or two. You might learn about if statements, you might learn about loops and how they work. So, the students get to try it, they get to try one hour. It's a great introduction. \\nWe did a survey last year looking at thousands of students before and after they tried the Hour of Code, and what we found was that it does increase the amount that they say, \"Hey, I like computer science or I'm interested in computer science.\" But, was especially cool for me was that the group that was the most impacted by doing this was high school girls. \\nHigh school girls were probably coming into it thinking, \"Hey, this is not something that I'm into.\" They try it and then they're into it. At this point, we've had  million hours of code around the world and it's been in 180 countries, it's in 50 languages. It's a huge event every December. We do it for CS Education Week, and basically it's just a way to introduce students around the world to computer science- \\nKEVIN SCOTT: That's incredible. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: -by actually building something. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. It's really incredible. \\nALICE STEINGLASS: Yeah. it's not just us, this is one of those things that we do in partnership with about 200 different companies and organizations that run it and do activities. Microsoft has partnered with us on the Minecraft Hour of Code for the last few years which is our most popular Hour of Code activity, and students and teachers love it. It's an opportunity to use these characters they're familiar with from Minecraft, but to learn computer science with them. \\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, what's the dream for Code.org? If you had a magic wand to wave over the world, and you can achieve whatever success you wanted to achieve, what does that look like? \\nALICE STEINGLASS: I think it looks like every child has the opportunity to learn computer science and that the students who are learning it look like the world. That the diversity matches, so that when we look at the workforce 20 years from now, whether somebody is in education or marketing or retail, they're going to be using computers. It's going to be a part of their lives and everybody gets to understand things like how the Internet works and how computers work. \\nAnd that when we look at the tech workforce, that the students who are   \n",
